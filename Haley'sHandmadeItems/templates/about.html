      <h2>Hello! My name is Haley</h2>
      <p>
        I’d love to share a little bit about myself. First and foremost, I’m a wife and a proud mom of four amazing children. Art has been a passion of mine for as long as I can remember, but recently, I felt inspired to share my work with others who appreciate art as much as I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love pushing my creative boundaries and exploring different mediums, from crocheted items, hand-tufted rugs, paintings, pet portraits, pyrography, and so much more. Every piece I create comes from a place of passion and a love for the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, you’ll find some of my creations. I also share more of my artwork on my Facebook page, where you’re welcome to check out my work. If you’d like me to create something special for you, scroll to the bottom of this page to send me your information directly. Thank you so much for stopping by—I appreciate your support!
